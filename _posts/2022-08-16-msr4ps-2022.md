Our paper, **"SecurityEval Dataset: Mining Vulnerability Examples to Evaluate Machine Learning-Based Code Generation Techniques"**, got accepted for The 1st International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories Applications for Privacy and Security(MSR4P&S' 22) co-located with ESEC/FSE 2022 in the short paper track. This work introduces an evaluation dataset to evaluate machine learning-based code generation techniques from the perspective of insecure code generation. We provide 130 samples and applications for assessing InCoder from Facebook Research and GitHub Copilot.
