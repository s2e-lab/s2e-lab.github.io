Our tutorial proposal, **"Program Analysis using WALA"**, got accepted at ESEC/FSE'22. 

In this tutorial, we walk through the process of using WALA for program analysis.
First, the tutorial will cover all the required background knowledge that is necessary to understand the technical implementation details of the explained algorithms and techniques. Subsequently, we provide a technical overview of the WALA framework and its support for analysis of multiple programming languages and frameworks code. Then, we will do several  live demonstration of using WALA to implement client analyses.  We will focus on two common uses of analysis: a form of security analysis, taint analysis,  and on using analysis graphs for machine learning of code.
