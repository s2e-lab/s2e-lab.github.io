Our paper, **"An Empirical Study of Code Smells in Transformer-based Code Generation Techniques"**, got accepted for the 22nd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2022) in the research track. The paper provides an empirical study on containing (security) code smell in the code generation dataset, and in the output of the code generation model. It also demonstrates the presence of code smell in the output of GitHub Copilot.
