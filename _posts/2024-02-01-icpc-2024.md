Our paper, **Understanding Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS): Insights from LLM-Generated Regexes and Developer Forums**, got accepted for the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2024). In this work, we analyzed the robustness in generating functionally correct and ReDoS-free RegEx by LLMs, how understandable the LLM-generated and real world ReDoS-vulnerable RegEx and what are the perspective of the developers for ReDoS vulnerability.
