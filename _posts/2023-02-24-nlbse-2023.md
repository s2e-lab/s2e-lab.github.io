Our short paper, **"Zero-shot Prompting for Code Complexity Prediction Using GitHub Copilot"**, got accepted at the 2nd InternationalWorkshop on Natural Language-based Software Engineering (NLBSE'23) co-located with ICSE 2023. 

In this short paper, we describe a preliminary study that investigates whether GitHub Copilot can help predict the runtime complexity of a source code using zero-shot prompting. In our preliminary study, we found that GitHub Copilot can correctly predict the runtime complexity 45.44% times in the first suggestion and 56.38% times considering all suggestions. We also compared Copilot to other machine learning, neural network, and transformer-based approaches for code complexity prediction. We observed that Copilot  outperformed other approaches for predicting code with linear complexity O(n).
