Our paper, **"Re(gEx\|DoS)Eval: Evaluating Generated Regular Expressions and their Proneness to DoS Attack**, got accepted for the 46th International Conference on Software Engineering - New Ideas and Emerging Results Track. In this work, we presented a novel dataset and framework to evaluate LLM-generated RegEx and ReDoS vulnerability. 

The Re(gEx\|DoS)Eval framework includes a dataset of 762 regex descriptions (prompts) from real users, refined prompts with examples, and a robust set of tests. We introduce the pass@k and vulnerable@k metrics to evaluate the generated regexes based on the functional correctness and proneness of ReDoS attacks. Moreover, we demonstrate the Re(gEx|DoS)Eval with three large language model families, i.e., T5, Phi, and GPT-3, and describe the plan for the future extension of this framework.
