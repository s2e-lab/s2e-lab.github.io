        abstract = {Many modern applications rely on Object-Oriented (OO) design principles, where the basic system components are objects and classes. They share objects with other processes, store them in disk/files for future retrieval or transport them over network to other systems. Object-oriented programs leverage numerous dynamic features and design principles such as runtime dispatching and object-oriented callbacks which allow flexible software design. Although seemingly innocuous, these features can be abused by the attackers to hijack the program's control flow to an undesirable behavior. This is referred to as Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP), in which attackers hijack objects in the program in order to create a sequence of method calls that introduce a malicious behavior. COOP is a type of code reuse attack in which a hacker hijacks objects (gadgets) in the program and use that to control the program execution flow via manipulating the sequence of methods and data being passed among these methods (gadget chains). In this paper, we describe a preliminary empirical investigation of COOP attacks in real software systems caused by untrusted object deserialization. In this preliminary study, we investigated the severity of these attacks, their consequences, and how they were mitigated by developers. Furthermore, we used the findings to create a dataset of vulnerable software projects and their fixes.},

        abstract = {Architecture-first approaches are increasingly widely adopted for addressing resiliency requirements in critical systems. In these approaches, the system is built from the ground-up to be resilient, starting with the system's architecture design. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the architecture design is robust, without any flaws that could compromise the system's ability to detect, prevent, react to or recover from adverse conditions, such as cyber-attacks. In this paper, we describe our ongoing efforts in aiding software architects in designing cyber-resilient systems by automatically detecting weaknesses in their architectural models.},

        abstract = {Through a set of well-defined interfaces, plug-and-play architectures enable additional functionalities to be added or removed from a system at its runtime. However, plug-ins can also increase the application’s attack surface or introduce untrusted behavior into the system. In this paper, we (1) use a grounded theory-based approach to conduct an empirical study of common vulnerabilities in plug-and-play architectures; (2) conduct a systematic literature survey and evaluate the extent that the results of the empirical study are novel or supported by the literature; (3) evaluate the practicality of the findings by interviewing practitioners with several years of experience in plug-and-play systems. By analyzing Chromium, Thunderbird, Firefox, Pidgin, WordPress, Apache OfBiz, and OpenMRS, we found a total of 303 vulnerabilities rooted in extensibility design decisions and observed that these plugin-related vulnerabilities were caused by 16 different types of vulnerabilities. Out of these 16 vulnerability types we identified 19 mitigation procedures for fixing them. The literature review supported 12 vulnerability types and 8 mitigation techniques discovered in our empirical study, and indicated that 5 mitigation techniques were not covered in our empirical study. Furthermore, it indicated that 4 vulnerability types and 11 mitigation techniques discovered in our empirical study were not covered in the literature. The interviews with practitioners confirmed the relevance of the findings and highlighted ways that the results of this empirical study can have an impact in practice.},

        abstract = {Architectural security tactics (e.g., authorization, authentication) are used to achieve stakeholders’ security requirements. Security tactics allow the system to react, resist, detect and recover from attacks. Flaws in the adoption of these tactics into the system’s architecture, an incorrect implementation of security tactics, or deterioration of tactic implementations over time can introduce severe vulnerabilities that are exploitable by attackers. Therefore, in this work, we present the Common Architectural Weakness Enumeration (CAWE), a catalog of known weaknesses rooted in the design or implementation of security tactics which can result in tactical vulnerabilities. We categorized all known software weaknesses as tactic-related and non-tactic related. This way, our CAWE catalog enumerates common weaknesses in a security architecture that can lead to tactical vulnerabilities. From our CAWE catalog, we found 223 different types of tactical vulnerabilities. In this work, we also used this catalog to study tactical vulnerabilities in three large-scale open source projects: Chromium, PHP, and Thunderbird. In a detailed analysis, we identified the most occurring vulnerability types on these projects. From this study we observed that (i) Improper Input Validation and Improper Access Control were the most occurring vulnerability types in Chromium, PHP and Thunderbird and (ii) “Validate Inputs” and “Authorize Actors” were the security tactics mostly affected by these tactical vulnerabilities. Moreover, in a qualitative analysis of 632 tactical vulnerabilities and their fixes in these systems, we characterized their root causes and investigated the way the original developers of each system fixed these vulnerabilities. From this qualitative analysis, we found 44 distinct root causes that lead to these tactical vulnerabilities. The results of this study not only show how architectural weaknesses in systems have created severe vulnerabilities, but also provide recommendations driven by empirical data for addressing such security problems.}
